title: 'Data Virtualization'
content: 'With the proliferation of Data Explosion & disparate data silos, there is a need for a data service layer to support information agility. The IT teams should be able to access data in real-time or near-real time from asymmetric data sources (on-premise or cloud) for business transactions, analytics & other payloads as a self-service data platform. DV leverages modern computing capabilities with traditional data integration techniques to deliver self-service access to real-time data at a lower cost with more speed & agility.'
